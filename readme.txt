Roll your own custom lorem ipsum generator

== Description ==

If you've ever had an idea for your own custom lorem ipsum generator (like Bacon Ipsum), this plugin will allow you to do so without any coding.  Just fill in a list of words, drop
the `[anyipsum-form]` shortcode in a post or page, and you have your very own custom ipsum generator.  Forked from [Bacon Ipsum](http://baconipsum.com/)

Includes:

* [anyipsum-form] shortcode for end-users to use, fully configurable
* custom words and filler text
* JSON API
* oEmbed support

The plugin installs Bacon Ipsum filler by default, so be sure to check Settings/Any Ipsum to fully customize your ipsum.
